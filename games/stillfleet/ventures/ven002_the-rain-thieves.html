<blockquote ><em>The Rain Thieves</em>,  the second official  <em>Stillfleet</em>  venture and setting sourcebook, offers classic sand-blasted sci-fi danger and discovery on the minor province of Radanaar.</blockquote>

<p>This desert planet—populated by domesticated, yoghurt-producing centipedes and intelligent giant “spiders” (well, that word is close enough)—has been literally  <em>forgotten</em>  by the Co.</p>

<p>Players, as you undertake this sweeping wilderness-crawl, will you do the Co.’s bidding and destabilize the fragile ecosystems of Radanaar’s great cave complexes in the search for new fungus technologies or other resources to extract?</p>

<p>Will you survive the dust cyclones and spider-ambushes? Will you discover the technical secrets of Kildz’s Antenna? Will you escort home a neighborhood of food tourists trapped here for two decades?</p>

This pulp-tastic, politically charged, eco-horror venture (playable scenario) is a great way to introduce new players to  <em>Stillfleet</em>  or challenge veterans with a campaign of rockside exploration and intrigue!
 
<em>The Rain Thieves</em>  features 100 pages of new rules, settings, encounters, archaetech, maps, speculative ecology, political fronts, and excerpts from a gastro-tourism guidebook for wetans (giant bugs).
