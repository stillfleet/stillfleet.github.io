> A sci-fi detective homage, originally written for spooky season 2022.

Inspired by everyone's favorite 1990s show about paranormal investigations, "The Nocturnal Lights"—our third official mini-venture (MV), written by our editor, Stephen Aubrey—sends the voidminers to a remote rock to check out rumors of a mysterious visitation... Also, there are lots of jalasti around.

Interesting bits contained in this short playable scenario:

- An unforgettable (perhaps strangely familiar) key NPC
- Lots of jalasti scientists
- Rules clarifications regarding stiffworks
- "Wolves"
- Space agriculture
