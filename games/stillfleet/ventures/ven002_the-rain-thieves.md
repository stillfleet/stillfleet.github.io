> The Rain Thieves, the second official Stillfleet venture and setting sourcebook, offers classic sand-blasted sci-fi danger and discovery on the minor province of Radanaar.

This desert planet—populated by domesticated, yoghurt-producing centipedes and intelligent giant “spiders” (well, that word is close enough)—has been literally *forgotten* by the Co.

Players, as you undertake this sweeping wilderness-crawl, will you do the Co.’s bidding and destabilize the fragile ecosystems of Radanaar’s great cave complexes in the search for **new fungus technologies** or other resources to extract?

Will you survive the dust cyclones and spider-ambushes? Will you discover the technical secrets of Kildz’s Antenna? Will you escort home a neighborhood of food tourists trapped here for two decades?

This pulp-tastic, politically charged, eco-horror venture (playable scenario) is a great way to introduce new players to *Stillfleet* or challenge veterans with a campaign of rockside exploration and intrigue!

***The Rain Thieves* features 100 pages of new rules, settings, encounters, archaetech, maps, speculative ecology, political fronts, and excerpts from a gastro-tourism guidebook for wetans (giant bugs).**
