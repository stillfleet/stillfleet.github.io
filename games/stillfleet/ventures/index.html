<blockquote>Discover thrilling stories set across the void—and across genres</blockquote>

<p>The official ventures (playable scenarios) for <em>Stillfleet</em> range from a full campaign—<em>The Rain Thieves</em>—to short one-offs that explore the many sides of science fiction—mini-ventures. And for a perfect introductory game session, check out the 25-page hulk-crawl <em>The Sleeper in the Sky</em>.</p>

<p>All ventures include riveting plots (with twists), encounters (statblocks), maps, lore, professional illustrations, and new rules.</p>

<p>A mini-venture is a high-quality, short, standalone supplement for <em>Stillfleet</em> or any Grit System game. A mini-venture is a playable story, but it can also include a gazetteer focusing more on a setting, a mini-game, a new set of rules for the Grit System, a series of maps or items or pre-gens, and so on.</p>
