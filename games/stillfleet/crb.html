<blockquote>Uniquely flexible mechanics. An unforgettable game cosmos. Politically charged cosmic fantasy at its weirdest.</blockquote>

<p>Set in a paradoxically bleak and vibrant superfuture, *Stillfleet* is a sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game that empowers players with simple, intuitive mechanics and hundreds of options for powers.</p>

<p>Built on a foundation of political tension between the Co. and its medieval market-worlds, *Stillfleet* is its own timespace paradox: it’s a rules-light system with hundreds of options for powers. And it’s a genre-vaporizing work of science fiction that you can hack apart and make your own.</p>

<p>The much-awaited full rules for *Stillfleet*—professionally designed and illustrated—are now available in a single PDF of 352 pages!</p>

<p>As heard on the [real-play podcast Fun City Ventures](https://funcity.ventures/category/float-city/), the game uses simple rules that take only minutes to learn. Yet the *Stillfleet Core Rulebook* offers much more, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 classes of Co. voidminer</li>
<li>22 playable sapient species</li>
<li>Hundreds of advanced powers, nanotech “blooder” powers, and deeply Weird  hell science powers</li>
<li>An entire chapter full of strange archaetech (weapons, cooking utensils, - nanotech body modifications…)</li>
<li>Rules for stiffworks (timespace gates)</li>
<li>Settings on major and minor provinces as well as the floating hulks of dead spaceships</li>
<li>Over 20 full encounters with dangerous aliens (statblocks)</li>
<li>An elegantly designed character sheet</li>
<li>An [online character randomizer](https://strings.stillfleet.com) by Aaron H.</li>
<li>Dozens and dozens of gorgeous original, full-color illustrations by  Ethan Gould and others</li>
<li>Intricate, worlds-building graphic design systems by Erich Lazar</li>
</ul>

<p>Play as a tech-hacking banshee, a peacemaking witness, a reality-warping tremulant, a giant bug, a strong AI trapped in a flash drive, a talking cactus, a void elf from the Dyson-sphere-enclosed Wytch Planet, Tnín… The choices are yours. The cosmos of Stillfleet is hilarious and horrifying. The struggles, all too real.</p>

<p>Voidminer—what will you do to resist the temptation of power? To liberate the provincials? To survive?</p>
