<blockquote> A drowned tyrant, an enchanted child, & ye steely eyed star-rijders</blockquote>

<p>Our fourth official mini-venture (MV)—the fully designed, map-driven “The Voice Beneath the Meer”—takes the voidminers to a sleepy/swampy county on the medieval province of Pays, where something odd is stirring beside the great Mukoth Meer.</p>

<p>Intended as an adjustably horrific story in a low-(cosmic-)fantasy setting, “Voice” comes with a heavy warning regarding mind control and ideas about how to run the venture otherwise.</p>

<p>Additionally, GMs and loreheads can simply run with the old-school TTRPG setting of Comté Bannanwyk! The mini-venture contains several maps and random tables related to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locations in the county</li>
  <li>Its (modest) capital fort-city</li>
  <li>A sample manor “haunted” by nanite-reanimated corpses&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>Other content to enjoy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ancient, long-sunken archaetech</li>
<li>3 full unique encounters, including the dread voidling or world-ghost</li>
<li>More amazing art by Ethan Gould!</li>
<li>All of the lore to-date regarding the province-world of Pays</li>
<li>Haunted forest locations</li>
<li>Random moon generator</li>
</ul>
