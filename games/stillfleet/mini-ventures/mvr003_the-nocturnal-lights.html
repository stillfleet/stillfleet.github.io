<blockquote>Meet Agent Yoriffo Dijkgraaf and his “standard science diplomacy”&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>This sci-fi detective homage, originally written for spooky season 2022, was inspired by everyone’s favorite 1990s show about paranormal investigations. “The Nocturnal Lights”—by our lead editor, Stephen Aubrey—sends the voidminers to a remote rock to check out rumors of a mysterious visitation… Also, there are lots of jalasti (salamanderoids) around.</p>

<p>Interesting bits contained in this short playable scenario:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An unforgettable (perhaps strangely familiar) key NPC</li>
  <li>Lots of jalasti scientists</li>
  <li>“Wolves”</li>
  <li>Space agriculture</li>
  <li>Cool map</li>
  <li>List of rooms on Station x-1013</li>
  <li>Did we mention a whole bunch of jalasti?</li>
  <li>Rules clarifications regarding stiffworks and Late Tephnian “shards”</li>
</ul>
