<blockquote> In this venture, you are contracted by the Nightwatch to complete an operation that could determine who is in power and what power looks like in Free Qadida.</blockquote>

<p>“Around the Dome” is the Stillfleet Studio’s 6th official mini-venture as well as a 22-page preview of  <em><a href="{% link games/stillfleet/gazetteers/qadida.html %}">Qadida</a></em>, the full-length gazetteer (setting sourcebook + venture) by Ian Derk.</p>

<p>Whether or not your group intends to run a spy-themed campaign in the domed city, this quick story—weaving across both Worshipful Qadida (run by the W.Co.) and Free Qadida (a fledgling anarcho-socialist state backed by H.Co.)—provides more than enough material for a fun, heart rate-raising venture.</p>

<p>Featuring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A playable scenario with (at least) half a dozen possible outcomes</li>
  <li>Rules for documentation status</li>
  <li>Random checkpoint encounters</li>
  <li>7 complete espionage encounters from a range of factions</li>
  <li>A full-page map of Qadida</li>
  <li>A new playable class: the hook (a detective or spyhunter)</li>
  <li>A timeline of the Worshipful Company’s involvement on Qadida</li>
  <li>Bombs, hidden agendas, lies, and other spycraft</li>
</ul>
