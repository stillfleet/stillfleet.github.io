> **"Around the Dome"** is the Stillfleet Studio's 6th official mini-venture as well as a 22-page preview of [Qadida]({% link games/stillfleet/gazetteers/qadida.md %}), the full-length gazetteer (setting sourcebook + venture) by Ian Derk.

Whether or not your group intends to run a spy-themed campaign in the domed city, this quick story—weaving across both Worshipful Qadida (run by the W.Co.) and Free Qadida (a fledgling anarcho-socialist state backed by H.Co.)—provides more than enough material for a fun, heart rate-raising venture.

## Featuring

- A playable scenario with (at least) half a dozen possible outcomes
- Rules for documentation status
- Random checkpoint encounters
- 7 complete espionage encounters from a range of factions
- A full-page map of Qadida
- A new playable class: **the hook** (a detective or spyhunter)
- A timeline of the Worshipful Company's involvement on Qadida
- Bombs, hidden agendas, lies, and other spycraft
