> Explore the full range of playable stories for Stillfleet by different creators

## Ready to run

Each mini-venture is a high-quality, 10–12-page, standalone supplement for Stillfleet or any Grit System game. A mini-venture is a playable story, and it can also include a gazetteer focusing more on a setting, a mini-game, a new set of rules for the Grit System, a series of maps or items or pre-gens, and so on.

Check out the range of mini-ventures we’ve published to date, and become a patron to support the development of new stories and collaborations!
