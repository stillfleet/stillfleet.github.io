For the first Stillfleet mini-venture, we were lucky to collaborate with the amazing hulk-designers over at Hyperdrive Fleet—the sci-fi-themed, high-quality battle-map Patreon from the minds and digital pens of Czepeku.

The venture is a struggle to avert a doomsday, already in progress, brought on by the planet-mining of the astrobrutalist husk gnomes. The voidminers must board the ship—The Scythe Compiling—and find a way to stop the diminutive cyborgs before an entire province-world is deconstructed.

Check out "Grim Harvest" for:

- Expectedly terrifying husk-gnome factoids ("lore")
- Memorably strange random husk gnome archaetech
- Interloping void elf "documentarians"
- An AI chimera
- Rival husk-gnome factions
- 2 full encounter blocks
- An *epic* plot!

All in only 9 pages!
