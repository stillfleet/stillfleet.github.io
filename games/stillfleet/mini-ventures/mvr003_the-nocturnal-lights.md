> Meet Agent Yoriffo Dijkgraaf and his “standard science diplomacy”…

This sci-fi detective homage, originally written for spooky season 2022, was inspired by everyone’s favorite 1990s show about paranormal investigations. “The Nocturnal Lights”—by our lead editor, Stephen Aubrey—sends the voidminers to a remote rock to check out rumors of a mysterious visitation… Also, there are lots of jalasti (salamanderoids) around.

Interesting bits contained in this short playable scenario:

- An unforgettable (perhaps strangely familiar) key NPC
- Lots of jalasti scientists
- “Wolves”
- Space agriculture
- Cool map
- List of rooms on Station x-1013
- Did we mention a whole bunch of jalasti?
- Rules clarifications regarding stiffworks and Late Tephnian “shards”
