<blockquote>Finally, you can pick up all 8 of the genre-hopping official mini-ventures (playable scenarios) for <em>Stillfleet</em> in a single volume of 196 pages.</blockquote>

<p>Peregrinations includes a gorgeous cover by Ethan Gould, a preface by Stillfleet Studio editor-emeritus Stephen Aubrey, and bonus appendices and short fiction by Stillfleet creator Wythe Marschall. This is a fantastic value for anyone looking to run or develop your own Stillfleet scenarios.</p>

<p>If you're new to the game, you're getting hours of material to enjoy by a range of writers (Wythe Marschall, Aaron H., Stephen Aubrey, Leonardo Andrade, and Ian Derk), plus a bonus guide on GMing the game.</p>

<p>If you're a veteran voidminer (and/or someone who's already run one or more of the mini-ventures), you're getting new crunchy NPC-generation tables, new encounters with art by Ethan, and a picaresque world-hopping short story.</p>

<p>Either way, this book is a steal. Hell, even if you don't play Stillfleet for some reason, it's full of great ideas for sci-fi TTRPG fun.</p>

<p>Many thanks to all of the playtesters, readers, and especially our Qadida backers and the patrons who made this book possible!</p>
