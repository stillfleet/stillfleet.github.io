<blockquote> Explore the full range of playable stories for <em>Stillfleet</em> by different creators.</blockquote>

<h2>Ready to run</h2>

<p>Each mini-venture is a high-quality, short, standalone supplement for <em>Stillfleet</em> or any Grit System game. A mini-venture is a playable story, and it can also include a gazetteer focusing more on a setting, a mini-game, a new set of rules for the Grit System, a series of maps or items or pre-gens, and so on.</p>

<p>Check out the range of mini-ventures weâ€™ve published to date, and become a patron to support the development of new stories and collaborations!</p>
