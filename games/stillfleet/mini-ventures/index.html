A mini-venture is a playable story, and it can also include a gazetteer focusing more on a setting, a mini-game, a new set of rules for the Grit System, a series of maps or items or pre-gens, and so on.</p>

<p>Get 8 ventures in one book! <em>Peregrinations: The Stillfleet Mini-Venture Bundle Vol. 1</em> contains 8 genre-hopping mini-ventures in a single volume of 196 pages, along with plenty of bonus content:</br>
