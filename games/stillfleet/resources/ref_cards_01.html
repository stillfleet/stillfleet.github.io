<blockquote>
  Our first volume of quick-reference cards includes 25 archaetech, 25 encounters, and 2 rules cards.
</blockquote>

<p>To help GMs and players make the most out of Stillfleet games, we’ve printed a deck of cards to help illustrate common game concepts—strange items and all-too-familiar aliens—and drive those everybody-leans-in moments of discovery at the table. The cards make great hand-outs for players, new and veteran.</p>

<p>To develop our first card deck, the whole team jumped in and contributed art and design elements. We loved making these cards, and we hope they’re of use to you!</p>

<p>For information on purchasing the Archaetech & Encounters deck, please reach out to the Stillfleet Studio team on Discord.</p>
