<blockquote>Randomize a character. Randomize an alien. Randomize an unforgettable story.</blockquote>

<p>To support players and GMs using the Grit System, we’re developing digital and physical tools, starting with the official <em>Stillfleet</em> web app, STRINGS, as well as colorful, functionality-focused card decks to help GMs bring excitement to their games.</p>

<p>You can use STRINGS to generate random characters, archaetech, aliens, names, and more—all for free.</p>

<ul class="rowlist">
  <li>
  <a href="https://strings.stillfleet.com/voidminers/recruitr/" class="external stillfleet dark">Generate a character with STRINGS</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://strings.stillfleet.com/" class="external stillfleet dark">Check out all of STRINGS</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
STRINGS is created by the official Stillfleet Studio banshee, Aaron H., and supported entirely by Patreon.</p>
