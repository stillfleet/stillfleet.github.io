This deck of at least 52 fully illustrated Stillfleet reference cards will consist of modular, detail-rich rooms within a techno-horrific hulk—a derelict spacecraft of Late Tephnian design, brimming with valuable and dangerous secrets (and perhaps a nanite-reanimated walker or mad AI or two)…

One side of each card will show the module, with clearly marked entrances/exist. The other side will contain GM tools such as archaetech, encounters, unique environmental threats, dialogue, and/or even venture hooks related to the module.

We can't wait to run crawls through a randomly generated hulk!
