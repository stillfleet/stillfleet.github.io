<blockquote>Build a derelict spaceship, one room at a time.</blockquote>

<p>This deck of at least 52 fully illustrated <em>Stillfleet</em> reference cards consists of modular, detail-rich rooms within a techno-horrific hulk: a derelict spacecraft of Late Tephnian design, brimming with valuable and dangerous secrets—and perhaps a nanite-reanimated walker or mad AI or two…</p>

<p>One side of each card shows the module, with dots indicating the number of portals (entrances/exits). The other side offers GM tools such as archaetech, encounters, unique environmental threats, dialogue, and even venture hooks related to the module.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to run crawls through a randomly generated hulk!</p>

<p>We are currently developing the HULKRAWL cards. For updates, please enquire on Discord.</p>
