> *Stillfleet* is a tabletop RPG about exploring ruined spacecraft—hulks—and habitable earth-like planets, cut off from contact with Terra for decades or centuries—rocks.

This *Quickstart* contains 42 pages of rules, entire classes, gear (sample weapons, armor, comms), aliens (6 encounters with full stats), settings, random tables, and a venture hook, as well as a separate document with 9 pregenerated characters—all different species and classes.

What’s inside:

- Core rules
- Introduction to the game cosmos
- Sample xenofauna (full statblocks)
- Sample archaetech items
- Nine different, fully playable pregenerated characters, with portraits
- Amazing illustrations by Ethan Gould
