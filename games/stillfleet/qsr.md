> Stillfleet is a new tabletop RPG about exploring ruined spacecraft—hulks—and habitable earth-like planets, cut off from contact with Terra for decades or centuries—rocks.

Players take the roles of "voidminers"—explorers working for the Worshipful Company of Stillfleeters, more often known simply as the Co. Their home, the alien space station nicknamed Spindle—a sea slug made of undulating black stone, kilometers tall—is a mystery to its own inhabitants. It brims with timespace gates called stiffworks, many of which are already tacked to habitable worlds…

This Quickstart contains 42 pages of rules, entire classes, gear (sample weapons, armor, comms), aliens (6 encounters with full stats), settings, random tables, and a venture hook, as well as a separate document with 9 Pregenerated Characters—different species and classes.
