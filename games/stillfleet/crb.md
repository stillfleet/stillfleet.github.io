> Uniquely flexible mechanics. An unforgettable game cosmos. Politically charged cosmic fantasy at its weirdest.

Set in a paradoxically bleak and vibrant superfuture, Stillfleet is a sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game that empowers players with simple, intuitive mechanics and hundreds of options for powers.

Built on a foundation of political tension between the Co. and its medieval market-worlds, Stillfleet is its own timespace paradox: it’s a rules-light system with hundreds of options for powers. And it’s a genre-vaporizing work of science fiction that you can hack apart and make your own.

The much-awaited full rules for Stillfleet—professionally designed and illustrated—are now available in a single PDF of 352 pages!

As heard on the real-play podcast Fun City, the game uses simple rules that take only minutes to learn. Yet the Stillfleet Core Rulebook offers much more, including:

- 10 classes of Co. voidminer
- 22 playable sapient species
- Hundreds of advanced powers + nanotech "blooder" powers + deeply Weird hell science powers
- An entire chapter full of strange archaetech (weapons, cooking utensils, nanotech body modifications...)
- Rules for stiffworks (timespace gates)
- Settings on major and minor provinces as well as the floating hulks of dead spaceships
- Over 20 full encounters with dangerous aliens
- An elegantly designed character sheet
- An [online character randomizer](https://strings.stillfleet.com/voidminers/recruitr)
- Dozens and dozens of gorgeous original, full-color illustrations by Ethan Gould
- Intricate worlds-building graphic design systems by Erich Lazar

Play as a tech-hacking banshee, a peacemaking witness, a reality-warping tremulant, a giant bug, a strong AI trapped in a flash drive, a talking cactus, a void elf from the Dyson-sphere-enclosed Wytch Planet, Tnín... The choices are yours. The cosmos of Stillfleet is hilarious and horrifying. The struggles, all too real.

Voidminer—what will you do to resist the temptation of power? To liberate the provincials? To survive?
