<h2>Beating 6</h2>

<p>In the Grit System, your scores are different dice types. The basic mechanic of *Stillfleet* is to roll a single score (a single die) and try to get a 6 or higher. The type of die you roll depends on what you’re trying to do. Contested rolls are won by the higher result. Ties go to the initiator of the action.</p>

<p>For uncontested rolls, a result of 6 or higher is a success on a roll of normal difficulty. And when one or more people help you do something, you get a +1 to your roll.</p>

  <dd class="five">Easy</dd>

  <dt class="six">6+</dt>
  <dd class="six">Standard</dd>

  <dt class="twelve">12+</dt>
  <dd class="twelve">"Impossible"</dd>

<h3>Boosting checks</h3>

<p>You can also boost your rolls by burning grit (GRT): you can burn (use up) 3, 6, or 9 GRT to add +3, +6, or +9 to any check.</p>

<h2>Assigning scores</h2>

<p>To make a player character (PC), AKA a voidminer, you must first choose a class and a species and then assign 5 die types to your 5 core scores. Here are your options. Either distribute:</p>

<pre>/// d12, d10, d8, d6, d6 ///   or   /// d12, d10, d8, d8, d4 ///</pre>

<p>This means that you either have no scores so low that you cannot succeed in a normal challenge without help, or that you have one low score and one extra d8 (which succeeds unaided on a 6, 7, or 8). The scores you assign, after choosing class and species, are these:</p>

<dl class="grid tight scores">
  <dt>COM</dt>
  <dd><strong>combat</strong><br/>
  use when rolling to attack or grapple</dd>
  <dt>MOV </dt>
  <dd><strong>movement</strong><br/>
  use when rolling to drive/pilot, dodge, initiate, parry, run, or sneak</dd>
  <dt>REA</dt>
  <dd><strong>reason</strong><br/>
  use when rolling to heal, know, make/repair, use technology (e.g., tack a stiffworks), or use a Weird power</dd>
  <dt>WIL</dt>
  <dd><strong>will</strong><br/>
  use when rolling to empathize, perceive, resist other (resist seduction, mind control, etc.), or resist world (resist explosions, falling rocks, poison, etc.)</dd>
  <dt>CHA</dt>
  <dd><strong>charm</strong><br/>
  use when rolling to control, negotiate, or seduce</dd>
</dl>


<p>Your voidminer’s mind and body are represented by these 5 primary scores and by 2 secondary or derived scores (your “pool”): health and grit.</p>
