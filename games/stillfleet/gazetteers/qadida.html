<blockquote> Take  <em>Stillfleet</em>  and the Grit System into a world of intrigue, assassination, and warfare that is quiet, cold, and high-stakes for the entire network of worlds exploited by the Worshipful Company of Stillfleeters.</blockquote>

<p>What happens when a rival organizationâ€”the anarchic Honourable Companyâ€”finally takes power from the Worshipful Company? Can half of a domed city on a dwarf planet survive alone? Is Free Qadida slipping into authoritarianism, or is that just more Worshipful Co. propaganda? Find out in Qadida:  <em>Spy Planet</em>!  (Successfully backed on Kickstarter in the summer of 2023!)</p>

<p>This 170-page book features an in-world introduction to the domed/divided dwarf planet, new rules, in-depth backgrounds on the two halves of the dome (Co.-controlled Worshipful Qadida and anarcho-socialist Free Qadida), a special format-busting section on the hell science-haunted demilitarized zone called The Span (think  <em>Roadside Picnic/Stalker</em>) , and two full-length espionage-filled ventures with new encounter blocks.</p>

<p>Illustrated with characteristic lush abandon by Ethan Gouldini,  <em>Qadida</em>  lovingly yanks the Grit System into the Venn-diagrammed genres of detective fiction, environmental horror, and cold-war intrigue. If youâ€™re looking for a fresh take on these themes,  <em>Qadida</em>  will scratch your itch and enhance your games. Get it todayâ€”but donâ€™t tell the Man a damn thing. ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<p>Thanks to all of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wythe/qadida-a-spy-filled-stillfleet-gazetteer/">our Kickstarter backers</a> in 2023! We couldnâ€™t have written or published this book without your support and input.</p>
