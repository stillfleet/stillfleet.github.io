> Have you ever wondered what it's like to be one aspect of a mycelial network? Do you enjoy "flipped dungeons" where you play as the villains? 

If you answered yes to either of these questions—and even if you didn't—you will probably love *Yuggothi Confidential*! Or at least part of you will! Because who among us is merely one thing and not also its opposites, its inchoate potentialities-otherwise? Amirite!?

## You are all—collectively—one mi-go, or sapient fungus from Pluto.

Your body plan roughly resembles that of a Terran crab, although you are also adorned with many biologically manufactured technical bits and bobs, and you normally reside inside a spaceship that looks like a dented bubble dipped in snot.

“You” are not, however, one mind, but a holobiont: an assemblage of fungal networks, technical apparatus, datasets, and linked organic and inorganic servitors…

In this game, each player controls one function of the mi-go’s totality. The functions work together toward a common goal, but each should fight for her own priorities and act in her own distinct style. Functions are encouraged to disagree: the rules provide a simple mechanism for resolving disagreement.

## You do not need a GM for this game, as the GM functions can be distributed.

This is not a roleplaying game (RPG) about combat or heroism, loot-stacking or princess-saving, but the quest for knowledge—unmoored from human weakness, unaccustomed to human morality—and the politics of decision-making.

NOTE: this is a truly weird game! We wrote it as a one-off mini-game for *Stillfleet*, but we think it is fun in its own right. (And the mi-go are also star bad-dudes in other science-horror RPGs.)
