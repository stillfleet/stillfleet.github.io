> Gazetteers are setting sourcebooks for Stillfleet, full of rich lore and new rules.

In addition to core rules and ventures, we’re developing sourcebooks to extend the game in a number of ways. Pick up Ian Derk’s Qadida today, for example, and enter a cold war between the Worshipful Company of Stillfleeters and a new anarcho-socialist state backed by the anti-capitalist Honourable Company… Plus, Qadida offers 4 new classes and 4 new playable species!

## Books in development

### Wretches

This short book provides everything you need to run a low-power/high-zaniness version of *Stillfleet* set in a nanite-haunted mall on an artificial mall-moon populated by dinosaurs and all manner of alien visitors. *Wretches* includes a full “grinder” for randomly generating fun low-power characters—including vat gnomes, chromatic humans, and mulg (moldfolk)—as well as dozens of pulpy venture hooks.

### Ruins × Monuments

This dual-sourcebook offers rules and lore regarding the ruins of Solspace outside of Terra as well as the monuments left behind by the Late Tephnians—those supposedly long-dead bogey-ancestors of today’s Terrans. *Ruins × Monuments* includes dozens of encounters, a variety of hulks for players to steal and fly around in, new rules for limitless use of the hell science, the secrets of the mi-go of Yuggoth, the culture of the noblefluencers of Tephnii, and of course gobs of archaetech (space junk, mantid biotech—we could go on).
