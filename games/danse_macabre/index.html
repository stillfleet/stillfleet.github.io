<blockquote>Explore—and survive—an Abandoned World where Death is not the end&hellip;</blockquote>


<p>In the twilight of the 14th century, death is no longer final: those who die are miraculously and terribly revived, each time with new maleficia—mutations of both the spirit and the flesh. Take on the roles of Pilgrims—those condemned to scrounge for resources outside the protection of their city-states, at risk of succumbing to the madness that lies beyond death.</p>

<p>Use the highly adaptable Grit System to explore, and survive, a shattered world packed with historical fantasy, religio-political intrigue, brutal combat, and hope—even in the darkest of ages. </p>

<p>The early playtest version of the game—Prima Mors—is coming soon!</p>

<h3>Excerpts from the game</h3>

<blockquote>The fresh brand on your neck, marking you as condemned, itches terribly as you approach the city gates&hellip;
</blockquote>

<p>Your caravan is filled with those like you—accused and accursed, branded with the Pilgrim’s badge. In recompense for your crimes, your company must wander the wilds in search of the enigmatic quintessence, sought by your city to protect its inhabitants from the curse of falsum mortem. A grim quest lies ahead of you, yet compared to the alternative—banishment to the wilds, never-ending unlife, and eternal damnation as a demoniac—this almost feels like a blessing&hellip;</p>

<p>With each rebirth came new maleficia, strange and terrible mutations which leave the bearer forever marked by false death. Multi-limbed flagellants, leonine merchants, beggars with flaming eyes, and two-headed priests became a common sight all across the world. While grotesque, many celebrated false death as a triumph of God over death, yet any appreciation for false death quickly dissipated once the demoniacs appeared&hellip;</p>

<p>It wasn’t long until rumors of natural death within the bounds of holy ground began to circulate&hellip;</p>
