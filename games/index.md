### Stillfleet: Explore the void. Try to survive.

Uniquely flexible mechanics. An unforgettable game cosmos. Politically charged cosmic fantasy at its weirdest. Set in a paradoxically bleak and vibrant superfuture, *Stillfleet* is a sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game that empowers players with simple, intuitive mechanics and hundreds of options for powers. In *Stillfleet*, players take the role of "voidminers" who explore ruined spacecraft—hulks—and habitable earth-like planets, cut off from contact with Terra for decades or centuries—rocks.

#### The Stillfleet Quickstart Rules

The free Stillfleet Quickstart Rules contains 42 pages of rules, entire classes, gear (sample weapons, armor, comms), aliens (6 encounters with full stats), settings, random tables, and a venture hook, as well as a separate document with 9 Pregenerated Characters—different species and classes.

#### The Stillfleet Core Rulebook

The *Stillfleet Core Rulebook* builds on the simple rules of the *Quickstart*, expanding the game with extremely fun character options and rich lore. (To the tune of 352 professionally designed pages!) The complete rules include 10 classes of Co. voidminer, 22 playable sapient species, hundreds of advanced powers, nanotech "blooder" powers, deeply Weird hell science powers, over 20 full encounters, and so much more.

### Blister Critters

**Play the world’s greatest cartoon animal TTRPG—Blister Critters!**

In *Blister Critters*, players take on the role of animals known as Critters in a radiation-blasted, eco-apocalyptic Saturday-morning cartoon! Humans are gone just like the ozone layer, and the world they left behind is overflowing with danger! *Blister Critters* is an innovative and surreal game in which Critters wield bizarre mutations called Blisters and physics-bending Nonsense powers. These strange abilities—artfully developed using the Stillfleet Studio’s Grit System—will help you survive in a vast, cruel suburbia populated by fellow Critters and their feral counterparts, Beasts.
