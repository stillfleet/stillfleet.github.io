## Explore the void. Try to survive. Experience *Stillfleet*.

Uniquely flexible mechanics. An unforgettable game cosmos. Politically charged cosmic fantasy at its weirdest. Set in a paradoxically bleak and vibrant superfuture, *Stillfleet* is a sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game that empowers players with simple, intuitive mechanics and hundreds of options for powers. In *Stillfleet*, players take the role of “voidminers” who explore ruined spacecraft—hulks—and habitable earth-like planets, cut off from contact with Terra for decades or centuries—rocks.

## Play the world’s greatest cartoon animal TTRPG—Blister Critters.

In *Blister Critters* by Odd Gob Games and the Stillfleet Studio, players take on the role of animals known as Critters in a radiation-blasted, eco-apocalyptic Saturday-morning cartoon! Humans are gone just like the ozone layer, and the world they left behind is overflowing with danger! *Blister Critters* is an innovative and surreal game in which Critters wield bizarre mutations called Blisters and physics-bending Nonsense powers. These strange abilities—artfully developed using the Stillfleet Studio’s Grit System—will help you survive in a vast, cruel suburbia populated by fellow Critters and their feral counterparts, Beasts.
