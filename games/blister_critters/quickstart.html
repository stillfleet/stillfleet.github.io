<blockquote>Pick your favorite varmint, grab your dice, and roleplay as a cartoon animal on a radiation-blasted Saturday-morning show!</blockquote>

<p>The humans are gone just like the ozone layer, and the world they left behind is overflowing with danger…</p>

<p>Enter <em>Blister Critters</em>, the new tabletop roleplaying game by Odd Gob Games and the Stillfleet Studio.</p>

<p>In this innovative and surreal game, you play as a small animal who can wield bizarre mutations called Blisters as well as physics-bending Nonsense powers. These strange abilities—artfully developed within the Grit System—will help you survive in a vast, cruel suburbia populated by fellow Critters and their feral counterparts, Beasts.</p>

<p>Luckily, the humans left behind a near infinite amount of Stuff—yes, that's the game term!—for you to arm yourself with, trade, or hack apart and reassemble using <em>Blister Critters</em>’ simple crafting rules. (Just watch out for self-aware Blistered Stuff, AKA Bliffs…)</p>

<h2>Either explore, thrive, and die as a Critter or live long enough to see yourself become a Beast.</h2>
