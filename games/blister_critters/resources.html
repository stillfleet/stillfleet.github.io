<p>Note, this video was created by Anthony Grasso for the ZineQuest 2024 campaign to fund the <em>Blister Critters Boxed Set</em>. Thanks to the band Elders for letting use one of their tracks as the <em>Blister Critters</em> theme song; thanks to Logan Dean, Leonardo Andrade, Richard Cross, LaunchBoom, Kickstarter, and BackerKit for helping us smash through our funding goal; and most of all thanks to our backers, without whom we could never have brought this game to life!</p>
