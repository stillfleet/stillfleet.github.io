The Blister Critters Boxed Set includes everything for your first episode and seasons to come:


<img src="/assets/img/brands/blister_critters/moue-revered.png" style="float:right" />


- The Blister Critters Rulebook: 100 pages of professionally written, edited, and designed mutant cartoon mayhem 🐢
- The Tons-o-Stuff Mega-Poster: a gorgeous, double-sided compilation of the relics of humanity (useful game items called Stuff), beautifully rendered, with stats 🐓 
- The Blister Critters Booster Pack: 48 poker-sized, CCG-like/poké-styled versions of Beasts and Bliffs that will spark fun when you whip them out 🦀 
- Blister Stickers: who doesn't want a full sheet of mutant cartoon animal stickers? 🦨
- Blister Critters dice: d4, d6 × 2, d8 × 2, d10, and d12 in brain-bending Blister colors 🐞 


Finally, play as a cartoon animal in a way that feels both narratively and mechanically intuitive. Blister Critters combines the best aspects of roleplaying: the gnarly—the bestial and high-stakes—with the zany—the mutant, cartoony, and nostalgic.


Both new and veteran RPG players love this intuitive, zany, infectiously fun game! Reserve your Boxed Set and:

- Dive right into an animal adventure! 🐴 
- Pick up the game's intuitive mechanics in minutes 🐷 
- Get everything you need to play in one box 🐼 
- Take control of a strangely familiar world 🐸 
- Turn eco-anxiety into a story with friends 🐯
