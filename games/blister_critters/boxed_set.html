<blockquote>Discover your inner cartoon-self!</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Blister Critters Boxed Set</em> includes everything for your first episode and seasons to come:</p>

<ul class="emoji">
  <li class="🐢">The Blister Critters Rulebook &ndash; 100 pages of professionally written, edited, and designed mutant cartoon mayhem</li>
  <li class="🐓">The Tons-o-Stuff Mega-Poster &ndash; a gorgeous, double-sided compilation of the relics of humanity (useful game items called Stuff), beautifully rendered, with stats</li>
  <li class="🦀">The Blister Critters Booster Pack &ndash; 48 poker-sized, CCG-like/poké-styled versions of Beasts and Bliffs that will spark fun when you whip them out</li>
  <li class="🦨">Blister Stickers &ndash; who doesn't want a full sheet of mutant cartoon animal stickers?</li>
  <li class="🐞">Blister Critters dice &ndash; d4, d6 × 2, d8 × 2, d10, and d12 in brain-bending Blister colors</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, play as a cartoon animal in a way that feels both narratively and mechanically intuitive. Blister Critters combines the best aspects of roleplaying: the gnarly—the bestial and high-stakes—with the zany—the mutant, cartoony, and nostalgic.</p>

<p>Both new and veteran RPG players love this intuitive, zany, infectiously fun game! Reserve your Boxed Set and:</p>
