> Pick your favorite varmint, grab your dice, and roleplay as a cartoon animal on a radiation-blasted Saturday-morning show!

The humans are gone just like the ozone layer, and the world they left behind is overflowing with danger…

Enter *Blister Critters*, the new tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) by [Odd Gob Games](https://oddgobgames.itch.io/) and the [Stillfleet Studio](https://stillfleet.itch.io/).

In this innovative and surreal game, you play as a small animal who can wield bizarre mutations called **Blisters** as well as physics-bending Nonsense powers. These strange abilities—artfully developed within the **Grit System**—will help you survive in a vast, cruel suburbia populated by fellow Critters and their feral counterparts, Beasts.

Luckily, the humans left behind a near infinite amount of **Stuff**—yes, that's the game term!—for you to arm yourself with, trade, or hack apart and reassemble using *Blister Critters*’ simple crafting rules. (Just watch out for self-aware Blistered Stuff, AKA Bliffs…)

If you stepped into the world of *Ren & Stimpy* or *Spongebob*, or if you enjoyed *Mausritter* or *Wanderhome* but wanted to set your game in Anytown, USA — or in *Gamma World* — this is the game for you!

### Either explore, thrive, and die as a Critter or live long enough to see yourself become a Beast.

The *Blister Critters Quickstart* contains everything you need to play. But remember, it's only a preview! The full rulebook will feature 100 pages of mayhem, including:

- 6 Critter categories consisting of 66 different animals
- 4 Blister paths full of dozens of mutant powers and cartoon-logic Nonsense powers
- 10 cartoon Roles to play in your party
- A new take on the Grit System, which takes only minutes to learn and naturally facilitates memorable story beats
- Simple narrative rules for Catchphrases, Ad-Libs, and other cartoon-show fun
