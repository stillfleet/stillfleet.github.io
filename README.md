To view your changes locally:
1. Install Ruby
2. Install Jekyll and bundler
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Nav to the server address it prints out (should be `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`)

If you have trouble, Jekyll's docs have good instructions for installing everything.

Worth noting that the serve command watches for file changes, so you shouldn't need to take any build steps after making a change, just refresh your browser.
