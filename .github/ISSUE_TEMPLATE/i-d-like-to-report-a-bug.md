Describe what task you were trying to do, or goal you had in mind. For example "I was looking for where to buy a book", or "I was trying to find the current rules for this game that you offer." 

Knowing what you're trying to do helps us better understand the needs of users.

**What did you do?**

Cite URLs if you can! Describe what you did in a way as if you were telling us in a chat or over the phone, so that we can try and reproduce the behavior and see what you saw. 

**What were you expecting to see?**

After you did the above steps, what were you hoping to see but didn't?

**What did you see instead? (optional)**

This might be unnecessary, but for cases like "the information is outdated" or "the link is incorrect" this is useful to know.

Screenshots are often very helpful, if you're able to provide them.
