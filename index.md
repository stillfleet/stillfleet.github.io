    <h2>Making Taxpunk Grimdark Sci-Fi</h2>
    <p>Stillfleet is a grimdark, taxpunk, politically charged tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) set in space, far into the ruinous future. Using a unique, highly flexible rules system, players explore ruined spacecraft—hulks—as well as earth-like planets that have been cut off from Terra for centuries.</p>
    <p>You are a voidminer—a salvager working for the Worshipful Company of Stillfleeters (the Co.). Your home, the alien space station nicknamed Spindle—a sea slug made of undulating black stone, kilometers tall—is a mystery to its own inhabitants. It brims with timespace gates called stiffworks, many of which are already tacked to habitable worlds…</p>
    <p>Theoretically, the players are working together to help the Co. recover long-lost technology and knowledge… In practice, this is not always the case.</p>
    <p>Thus Stillfleet is really two different games, one hulkside—a series of explorations of technical structures in outer space—and the other rockside—a political game about managing (or destroying) a company distributed across many worlds.</p>
    <p>The Core Rulebook is currently in development. But playtest rules exist, and many gamers have already discovered the joys of voidmining.</p>

    <h2>Why We Roll</h2>
    <p><strong>Why We Roll</strong> is fun and practical in tone, combining the benefits of a shoot-the-shit professional chat with an advice show, and including some actual-play segments. Chris and Wythe take a sensitive, curious, ecumenical approach to game design, and their perspectives are informed by years of work on their own games. Between conversations, Chris and Wythe work through specific problems in the course of playing new games, often with one of the games’ designers.</p>
