## Rolling dice

### Beating 6

The basic mechanic of the Grit System is to roll a single die and try to get a 6 or higher. The type of die you roll depends on what you’re trying to do. Contested rolls are won by the higher result (or, among many actors, the highest one). Ties go to the initiator of the action unless otherwise stated.

For all uncontested rolls, unless otherwise stated, a result of **6** or higher is a success on a roll of normal difficulty. And when one or more people help you do something, you get a +1 to your roll. You can also boost your rolls.

#### Uncontested check difficulties

 - Easy: 5+
 - **Standard: 6+**
 - Difficult: 7+
 - Very difficult: 9+
 - “Impossible”: 12+

### Assigning scores

To make a player character (PC), you must first choose a class and a species and then assign 5 die types to your 5 core ***scores***. Here are your options. Either distribute:

    /// d12, d10, d8, d6, d6 ///   or   /// d12, d10, d8, d8, d4 ///


This means that you either have no scores so low that you cannot succeed in a normal challenge without help, or that you have one low score and one extra d8 (which succeeds unaided on a 6, 7, or 8). The scores you assign, after choosing class and species, are these:

 - **COM (combat)** – *use when rolling* to attack or grapple
 - **MOV (movement)** – *use when rolling* to drive/pilot, dodge, initiate, parry, run, or sneak
 - **REA (reason)** – *use when rolling* to heal, know, make/repair, use technology (e.g., tack a stiffworks), or use a Weird power
 - **WIL (will)** – *use when rolling* to empathize, perceive, resist other (resist seduction, mind control, etc.), or resist world (resist explosions, falling rocks, poison, etc.)
 - **CHA (charm)** – *use when rolling* to control, negotiate, or seduce

Your PC’s mind and body are represented by these 5 primary scores and by 2 secondary or derived scores (your “pool”): health and grit.

> **FEATURE: “NPC scores”:** The average unskilled non-player character (NPC) has straight d6s, meaning they have only a 1 in 6 chance of accomplishing a heroic task without special training, technological aid, or help from a friend. Skilled NPCs (soldiers, scientists) have straight d8s. A player character begins play with a much better chance of accomplishing many heroic tasks, even without using special powers.

### Making a check

When you want to do something in the Grit System, if it’s not hard to do and isn’t being contested, it just happens. If there’s a chance you can *fail* at it, or if it really matters that you do it *just right*, or that you do it *right now*, or if someone is trying to *stop you*, you have to roll a ***check***.
 
When calling for a check, think of a check as the verb you want to perform. Are you trying to steer a hovertank (**MOV/drive**)? To flee (**MOV/run**)? To hurt someone (**COM/attack**)? Defend yourself (**MOV/dodge**)? To bake a pie (**REA/make**)? Sense if someone is lying to your face (**WIL/perceive**)?

Checks play a basic role by structuring combat, responses to massive shocks, the use of common and uncommon skills, and, in many cases, the use of special powers including archaetech and the hell science (“the Weird,” “psyonix,” “magick,” and other ultranatural powers).

### Advantage and disadvantage

Often, due to a class power or some other effect, you will have to roll with ***advantage*** or with ***disadvantage***. This mechanic is very simple: if you have advantage, roll two dice instead of one, and take the better result. If you have disadvantage, roll two dice and take the worse result.

### Rolling a 1, rolling a maximum

Whenever you must roll one die to achieve a binary result—make a thing happen or fail to make it happen—**you fail whenever you roll a 1**, regardless of points spent to boost the roll (see below), regardless of die type. If the task is so easy that there’s no chance of failure, then you shouldn’t roll at all.

This rule does *not* apply to purely quantitative rolls: damage, pool regeneration, number of meters an object is hurled, e.g. Conversely, on any non-quantitative roll, *at least* the maximum rolled result will always be a success. There is no point in rolling if the result is automatically positive or negative (the highest die-value won’t be a success).

The Grit System does not automatically privilege high rolls. That said, the GM *can* and probably should reward a max-value roll with some minor bonus or unexpected positive effect. This makes the game more fun!

> **FEATURE: “Rolling a 1”:** If you can fail, you should roll—and cross your fingers not to get a 1. Rolling a 1 represents bad luck, fate, or a surprise obstacle preventing your success in this moment. Players, narrate what goes wrong when you roll a 1! Bad luck, by the way, doesn’t mean hitting yourself or watching your gun explode in your hand—just missing or otherwise failing to do the thing you were trying to do. That said, if your weapon can misfire, break, or run out of energy, then it generally does so when you roll a 1 to attack. (This is up to the GM’s creativity and cruelty.)

## Checks

### Combat

Combat represents your total offensive aptitude, including your aim, but excluding your ability to dodge attacks and your speed. Combat and movement collectively represent your body, but they are not symmetric scores. They are based purely on function, what you do with your body. You are free to be a small, frail-looking character with an amazing combat score or a huge hulk who can’t fight well. You roll your COM die when making attack checks.

### Movement

Movement represents your body in all regards except for attack. Movement checks are vital to several aspects of the game, including dodging, piloting, running, sneaking, and using fine motor skills. MOV also represents your hand-eye coordination; use it to roll checks regarding disabling traps, opening locks, performing music, performing sleight-of-hand, picking pockets, and stealing.

### Reason

Reason represents not only your abstract reasoning skills (logic) but also your accumulated store of information and how fast you can retrieve it. Whenever your character needs to know if they know something, roll REA. This applies to finding clues and tracking down informatic things (not perceiving physical things). Reason checks include those relating to archaetech and biomedicine, as well as those related to conscious control of the hell science. You also make REA checks to use certain hell science powers.

### Will

Will represents the parts of your mind that you—as in, your conscious pattern of thoughts and emotions—cannot directly access but must frequently rely upon. This includes your sensorium. Will checks relate to unconscious awareness, self-presence, instinct, alertness, and other non-frontal lobe brain tasks. Perceive is the WIL check you’ll make most frequently. You roll **WIL/perceive** to notice useful and/or dangerous things around you, to sense motives and detect lies, and to avoid surprise attacks.

The WIL checks *resist other* and *resist world* function as universal saving throws. Resist checks may be coupled as needed with checks of other scores, most often MOV (to represent, say, jumping out of the way of an explosion). You may need to roll a resist check against a volcano, the seductive wiles of a famous spy, or the mind-probe of a torturedrone. You also roll resist checks against environmental threats such as radiation, infections, venoms, and intrusions of the Escheresque into three-space.

### Charm

Charm represents how others perceive you, as well as your ability to confidently lead or manipulate others. Charm, like reason, is used in many different non-physical situations. All forms of deception, seduction, acting, haggling, motivating, and charisma-based (not fine motor skill-based) performing are CHA checks. So are checks related to calling for a ceasefire or otherwise turning the mood of a situation. CHA also covers intimidation. If you’re trying to hurt someone’s pride, you’re using CHA, not COM. COM only covers intent to physically harm.

## Pool

### Starting pool

In addition to your scores, which do not change (often), you have two fluctuating sets of points that collectively are called your ***pool***. You “burn” (spend) these points, either when you take damage or use special powers. **When you run out of total pool, you die**. These are the two halves of your pool:

 - **HEA (health)** – ***Health*** represents your body’s robustness and your ability to deal with trauma. At first level, your HEA is your maxCOM +maxMOV (before any species bonuses). When you reach 0 HEA, you become seriously injured, or prone, and can no longer act. When you reach 0 HEA and 0 GRT, or if someone attacks you while you’re prone, you die.
 - **GRT (grit)** – ***Grit*** is a representation of your ability to perform stressful activities such as psychically reading a judge’s thoughts, inspiring a ragtag army to advance against overwhelming opposition, or forcing yourself to attack twice in a split second. Your starting grit is determined by your class. Most powers cost grit to use. When you reach 0 GRT, you are simply exhausted, overwhelmed, and unable to use special powers.

### Recovering pool

You have **maximum** and **temporary** HEA and GRT scores. Grit goes down when you use special abilities. Unlike your HEA score, your GRT can sometimes be boosted beyond its maximum. Note, when you sleep and regain pool, you do *not* increase these scores above their maximums.

To regain pool, you need to rest 5+ hours: sleep if you’re a human, meditate under a sunlamp if you’re a photobiont, put your drives into standby if you’re an aux or pepper elf, etc. If you do, you recover **dMOV +dWIL +your level** pool (so, minimum 3), distributed as you like between HEA and GRT. This means, roll your MOV die and your WIL die and add these results to your level.

You can regain pool naturally once every 24 hours; otherwise, to heal, you need help from another source, such as a biomedical or Weird healer.

If you don’t rest for 5+ hours out of every 24, choose one score: this lowers by one die type. Every day that you don’t rest, choose another score to lower. After five sleepless days, you collapse into a coma and become prone.

> **FEATURE: “Gaining more pool”**: You gain 6 permanent pool per level, to be distributed as you like between HEA and GRT.

### Becoming prone and dying

Your HEA and GRT represent energy, attention, and readiness to fight. Losing a good amount of HEA can represent becoming fatigued during a stressful firefight. Being reduced to 0 HEA represents a serious injury, or a near-death experience…

When you reach 0 HEA but still have GRT remaining, you fall unconscious and become vulnerable. In game terms, you’re ***prone***: if any character or force (lightning, shark) deals damage to you, that damage burns your remaining GRT instead of HEA. If they slit your throat, you die. If you reach 0 GRT as well as 0 HEA, you die. No use of medical science will revive your character.

Becoming prone means suffering from a serious injury. When you are prone but still have GRT, you can no longer be revived by the basic power *give aid* (GM’s discretion). You can be revived with biomedical healing (pir class powers) or with rest.

After resting for one night and regaining pool, you still feel groggy and slow: **one of your scores suffers from a −3 penalty until the venture ends** and you take some time off (R&R). Further, whenever you recover from having fallen to 0 HEA, **your health permanently drops by 1**.

## Powers

### The time of powers

Powers are both basic and special abilities. Different powers take different amounts of abstract game time to use:

 - **Standard** powers take some amount of time between 1 and 10 seconds. In game terms, they use up your action for the ***round*** when in initiative. If you use a standard power, you can’t take any other serious action that round (e.g., attack, use the hell science, or call for a check that would take more than a split second). But you can jog up to 5 meters (M), grab something from your toolbelt, shout at a comrade, etc.
 - **Free** powers can be used at will. You can use any number of free powers per round. These can be chained together if you like. They represent split-second reactions, instantaneous quantum outcomes, and predetermined states of being that suddenly affect the situation.
 - Other active powers require **ten minutes**, **an hour**, or some other amount of time to work.
 - Yet other powers are **permanent**, meaning they just become part of your scores, or **passive**, meaning they happen automatically in response to something.

### Basic powers

Your class and species will determine what special powers your PC has. All characters, however, can use the following basic powers:

1. **Attack** (standard) – Roll **COM/attack**; your target rolls **MOV/dodge**: if you tie or get the higher result, you deal damage, which reduces your opponent’s HEA. The damage you deal is determined by your weapon. If you are attacking unarmed, you deal your d2 damage or, if you are a stillrijder or otherwise trained in combat, dCOM damage. While attacking in normal atmo, you may move 5 M in any direction. Grappling, pushing back, restraining without harming, and knocking out are all types of attack. Disarming an opponent is a *called shot* (see below).
    1. **Multiple attacks** – Warrior classes can use the class power double tap to make two attacks in the same round without penalty. Other characters can also burn GRT to strike more than once, but they are more likely to miss: when making two attacks in the same round, burn 4 GRT; the first attack suffers a −1 penalty to hit; the second, a −3.
    2. **Attacking from cover or in low light, or attacking hidden targets** – When attacking a target hidden behind **light cover** (a pillar that doesn’t protect them completely, a tree) or when attacking in **low light**, characters with normal vision suffer a −2 to hit. When shooting at a target who is **fully covered** or when attacking in **complete darkness**, these characters suffer a −4 to hit.
2. **Boost** (free) – Your mind empties and your eyes close as you draw back the proverbial bow: burn 3, 6, or 9 GRT; you gain +3, +6, or +9 on your next roll. *N.B., this is arguably the most important power in the game. At any point, on any roll, you can burn 3X to gain +3X.*
3. **Call shot** (standard) – You aim, steel yourself, and strike the blow true: describe any specific non-Weird intended effect of your attack, such as blinding or disarming your target. Burn 4 GRT and roll to attack with *disadvantage*. If you hit, the desired effect happens, and you deal *double damage*—or, if you prefer, zero damage. Note, you can boost neither, one, or both of your rolls to hit with disadvantage; the lower value is taken, regardless.
4. **Convert** (free) – You cannibalize your body’s strength for sheer git-r-dun willpower: burn 3 HEA; you gain +1 GRT.
5. **Dodge** (free) – You may dodge every time you are attacked, unless you are restrained or comatose. Dodge is a MOV roll against an opponent’s **COM/attack** roll. N.B., you must get a *higher* result, not an equal one, to dodge an attack, since the attacker initiated the action.
6. **Give aid** (standard) – You spend the round helping someone who is wounded—bandaging cuts, e.g. This person regains 2 HEA. If this person is afflicted by an ongoing *bleed* or other condition that a non-healthcare professional could quickly treat, it stops. You can only give aid *once per wound*; i.e., after combat ends, you can’t just keep restoring 2 HEA over and over again. Serious medical help is represented by the pir power *heal*.
    1. **Using medication in combat** –  Cleaning and bandaging a wound takes an entire round. Popping a single pill takes no time: in game terms, it’s a free action.
7. **Initiate** (special) – Whenever you attack or are attacked, or use a Weird power or resist one, ***initiative*** begins: first you resolve any ***ambush*** attacks (most real fights involve one side surprising the other); then everyone rolls **MOV/initiate** to determine the order in which subsequent events occur. Equal results indicate that actions happen simultaneously. Initiative can also be used for non-combat situations that are time-sensitive (defusing a bomb, escaping an erupting volcano, making a series of arguments before a court of law, e.g.).
8. **Run/flee** (standard) – Instead of attacking or using another standard power, you may run full tilt into or away from the fray. You move maxMOV × 3 M and gain a +1 to all dodge rolls this round.
9. **Parry** (standard) – Instead of attacking or running, you may choose to actively defend yourself: you can reroll *all* failed dodge rolls this round; every time you successfully dodge, you gain a further +1 to subsequent dodge rolls this round. These bonuses do not carry over from round to round. While parrying, you can move 5 M in any direction.
10. **Use class, species, tech, or Weird power** (varies) – Other powers work according to a variety of mechanics. The important thing to remember about all of them is that free powers take no time and thus “stack.” You can *always* boost or convert—or use any other free power—as long as you do so *before* rolling a check or using a standard power.

> **FEATURE: “Boosting”**: In terms of game mechanics, the Grit System revolves around a core wager: how much grit are you, the player, willing to spend to overcome the challenge currently being thrown at you by the GM? *Boost* is the core power by which this wager is resolved. If you don't boost a roll, you save 3, 6, or 9 grit—but you also risk failing. If you boost, you can often succeed simply by not rolling a 1 (which is always a failure on any roll that can be failed). So *boost* is more than one of a number of basic powers, it is a central driver of tension for the whole game!

> **FEATURE: “Key terms”**: Note, most powers are verbs; you do a power. This makes “acting” simpler. And for brevity, scores are written as three-letter abbreviations (COM, GRT, etc.). The phrase “dCOM” means “roll your combat die [whatever it is].” The phrase “dREA +1” or “dWIL −2” means “roll your [whatever] score and [add or subtract whichever amount].” The phrase “maxCHA” means “the highest value of the die that your CHA is.” The phrase “+your level” means “add the number that your level currently is.”

## Combat

### The turn order

Combat is a series of ***rounds*** that begins with a contest of *initiative*: everyone who plans to act rolls a special **MOV/initiate** check to join the fray. The highest result goes first; tied results happen simultaneously. All characters act in order from highest to lowest. *Ambushes*, surprises, and stabs-in-the-back happen in a special round before the first round.

When it’s your turn, you can do whatever you want: you get one *standard action* and infinite *free actions*. You can also jog a generous 5 M in any direction while doing whatever you’re doing, such as stabbing or Weirding out, unless you use a power that specifically requires you to remain still.

To attack, roll **COM/attack**; your opponent rolls **MOV/dodge**. You win on a tie or if your result is higher. Damage is by weapon. Armor reduces damage by providing ***damage reduction***, or ***DR***. Unless otherwise specified, all damage comes off your HEA first. When you reach 0 HEA, you become prone. When you reach 0 HEA and GRT, or when someone tries to kill you while you are prone, you die.

If you are attacked, roll **MOV/dodge**. You must roll higher than your attacker. Dodging is a free action: roll to dodge every time you are attacked.

When everyone who has rolled initiative has acted, the round ends. A new round then begins. Combat ends when everyone dies, gives up, makes peace, or flees.

> **FEATURE: “Timing”**: A “round” is an abstract unit of time approximately equal to 10 seconds. “Initiative” is an abstraction that determines when things happen within a round. The distances between different initiative rolls can be thought of as seconds: a character acting on initiative 6 is about 4 seconds faster, in some way, than a character acting on initiative 2. This is just a rule of thumb! The point is simply to keep the action moving forward.

<blockquote class="optional">
<strong>FEATURE: “Combat and consent”</strong>: Many RPGs treat violent conflict as a given. Others eschew it altogether. It is up to your group how often and how brutal combat is, in your game universe. The Grit System caters both to groups that enjoy combat (you can blow up dangerous aliens) and those that prefer non-combat encounters (you can also talk to enemies, run away from them, trick them, seduce them…).
<br />
It is the GM’s job to make sure that everyone at the table is comfortable with how your group will play through combat encounters, if at all. Peppering your game with violent conflicts when some players are not comfortable with violence is not cool!
</blockquote>

#### Combat flowchart

1. Initiate action.
2. Deal with ambushes (ambushers attack first regardless of initiative).
3. Deal with attacks and other standard powers in initiative order.
4. Deal with dodges after every attack (dodges are free actions).
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until everyone dies or stops fighting.

### Grappling

To ***grapple*** an opponent, roll **COM/attack**; your opponent rolls their **MOV/dodge**. If your result is equal to or higher than theirs, then you deal no damage but gain control of their body for the next round. **Neither of you can dodge while either of you is grappling.**

The next round, if you wish to concentrate on continuing your physical dominance, roll COM; your opponent rolls COM, *not* MOV, −1. (They roll COM because they’re unable to dodge and must grapple with you.)

On the third round, your opponent rolls COM −2, and so on, until the penalty is equal to their maxCOM, at which point they are pinned and cannot act as long as you don’t take another action.

### Disarming

You can use the basic power *call shot* or the advanced power *disarm* to take away an opponent’s weapon—or whatever they’re holding.

If you hit with a called shot, you can both disarm your opponent and deal damage, or choose only to disarm your opponent. If you use the power *disarm*, you inflict no damage, but your target can’t use their weapon again until they burn a standard action to pick it up, reassemble it, etc. (You describe how the disarmament happens, but the mechanical effect is the same.)

Why have two powers that allow you to disarm opponents? Because *call shot* is more general and harder to pull off. *Disarm* is a different, specific martial arts move (however you interpret it), representing training in non-lethal combat.

### Bleed, burn, and stun

Certain weapons have the tag **bleed** or **burn**. When a weapon with *bleed* X or *burn* X hits, it causes X additional damage when it hits *and* X additional damage on each subsequent round until the bleeding/burning character takes a round to treat their wounds.

In the case of *burn* X, this damage is *cumulative* (fire spreads). So, a plasma torch that does 1 damage and has *burn* 1 causes 1+1 damage on round 1, 1+2 damage on round 2, and so on…

Other weapons have the tag ***stun***. Whenever a weapon with *stun* X hits, roll a d6: if the result is equal to or lower than X, then the target is stunned—immobilized—for X rounds. 

For example: Jerro the Fleeter jackal steals a Snakeman planckion lash with *bleed* 3 from the Archive. He later gets into a fight with one of the Eaters of the Dead, Spindle’s exosuited gendarmes. On round one, Jerro tears open the gendarme’s suit and opens a massive gash, dealing 1 damage plus *bleed* 3. On round two, even if Jerro runs away or misses, the gendarme takes 3 damage.

### Toxins and radiation

Some attacks may be debilitating in other ways then by causing hemorrhages, burns, or concussions. Simple ***toxins*** (venoms, poisons, chemicals that aren’t good for humans or giant crickets to breathe in or swallow, etc.) result in nausea, causing characters who are exposed to them to suffer *disadvantage* on all rolls for a set amount of time. More potent, fast-acting toxins also call for a **WIL/resist** world check: failure results in d20 damage.

Toxicity is generally measured in minutes or hours, but short-acting venoms are limited to rounds. E.g., the venom delivered by the sting of a Gigoix murkwasp persists in the human or wetan system for d6 rounds, as opposed to d20 minutes for a professional Kemmerathi assassin’s zaqarash tea.

Dangerous ***radiation*** exposure causes victims to suffer disadvantage on *checks* to recover *pool*, specifically. This condition typically lasts for d6 days if treated, or indefinitely, if left untreated. In general, informatic beings are immune to toxins but *not* radiation: bombardment by high-energy protons degrades hard drives just as it creates copy errors in DNA.

### Surge die

GMs: sometimes combat drags. Besides reminding everyone to *boost* liberally, the best remedy is to introduce a ***surge die***. There are many variations on the surge die. The simplest mechanic is to—at the top of the second round of combat, before any PC or NPC has acted—**take any die and set it to show the 1**: now everyone must add +1 to all rolls, regardless of the type. Then increase this surge to +2 the next round, moving the die to show 2; +3 the round after, and so on, until someone wins combat and/or everyone dies.

The effect is to speed everything up and raise the stakes of all choices. Attacks become more likely to hit; but dodges also become more likely; but also damage increases; but also-also the costs of powers increase… PCs will inevitably burn more GRT boosting as they realize that the stakes have increased overall. The math remains fairly simple.

### Mob rules

Trying to fight a large group of enemies—a ***mob***—is inherently dangerous for a small team. A mob can consist of any type of entity (angry farmers, professional soldiers, deadly androids, rabid vulture-headed cave-monkeys wielding enerjawn-saws, etc.). The members of the mob hold a variety of weapons and are variously well-trained. For game purposes, however, the mob is acting as a single threat comprising many bodies but sharing a single, averaged set of scores.

Fighting a mob works like fighting a single opponent: it rolls initiative; on its turn, it rolls to hit; when attacked, it rolls to dodge; when struck by weapons, it loses health. Mobs do not have DR, GRT, or powers. If anyone in the mob is particularly interesting—say, a leader hopped up on quantum-psychedelic drugs, or a specialist with a superior weapon—then keep track of them separately during combat.

There are a few differences between mobs and non-mobs.

1. Decide in advance if a given mob (mostly) has missile weapons or not. If its members have guns or bows, then the whole mob will continue to shoot at the PCs until the PCs escape out of range or take deep cover, becoming unassailable. If not, then the PCs can run away from the whole mob by winning a contested MOV/run check.
2. Running away from a mob is hard: within it, there are lots of people trying to pull the PCs back, hold them down, and trip them up. PCs roll to run away with disadvantage. At the same time, mobs generally aren’t very fast or well-coordinated, especially at scale. So mobs’ MOV scores decrease in type the larger that they get.
3. At the same time, mobs’ COM scores increase in type as they gain members, since more attackers will get lucky, find openings, help one another, etc.
4. Mobs inflict automatic damage each round, based on the total number of fighters. This damage ignores damage reduction (DR). It represents some sufficient number of the mob getting lucky and finding openings when the PCs are distracted. Mobs with missile weapons continue to inflict automatic damage as long as the PCs are in range.
5. In addition to the automatic damage that the mob inflicts, roll once per round for the mob to attack. If the mob hits, it inflicts XdCOM damage, where X is determined by the average war-fighting training of the mob (up to the GM).
6. The mob has HEA, and when it runs out, it can no longer act as a mob. This does not mean that every single member of the group has been slain or knocked out—simply that enough are dead, seriously injured, scared, or confused so as to allow the PCs to take off, if they want to. If the PCs want to kill every last member of the mob, then make them fight at least a few interesting individuals with useful-in-combat powers but low HEA. These are the injured diehards, zealots, or opportunists.

#### Types of mob by size

1. **Group of 2–5 (fire team)** – COM d6, MOV d8, HEA 24, d4 automatic damage per PC per round (DR has no effect)
2. **Group of 6–11 (squad)** – COM d8, MOV d8, HEA 48, d6 automatic damage per PC per round (DR has no effect)
3. **Group of 12–23 (patrol)** – COM d10, MOV d6, HEA 72, d8 automatic damage per PC per round (DR has no effect)
4. **Group of 24–47 (platoon)** – COM d12, MOV d6, HEA 96, d10 automatic damage per PC per round (DR has no effect)
5. **Group of 48–99 (echelon)** – COM d20, MOV d4, HEA 120, d12 automatic damage per PC per round (DR has no effect)
6. **Group of 100+ (company)** – COM d100, MOV d4, HEA 144, d20 automatic damage per PC per round (DR has no effect)

#### Mob damage by training level

1. **Nonprofessional** – dCOM damage
2. **Grunt** – 2dCOM damage
3. **Elite** – 3dCOM damage
4. **Assassin** – 4dCOM damage
