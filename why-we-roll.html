<p>Topics covered to date include game-design inspirations and best practices, the politics of games, illustrating game concepts, cards as mechanics, character backstories, party formation, eco-catastrophes, epic powers and “boss fights,” espionage in games, faction rules, genres, “medieval” settings, hit points versus wounds, “madness” rules, safety at the table, solo RPGs, the OSR or even the NSR, what makes a game a game, what makes a system a system, product development, the business of indie RPGs, and so much more!</p>
