# Contributing

## Overview

1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/stillfleet/stillfleet.github.io/fork)
2. Make changes
3. [Submit a new Pull Request](https://github.com/stillfleet/stillfleet.github.io/compare)
4. Tag @armahillo as a reviewer!

## Setup Environment

To view your changes locally:

1. Install Ruby
2. Install Jekyll and bundler
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Nav to the server address it prints out (should be `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`)

If you have trouble, Jekyll's docs have good instructions for installing everything.

Worth noting that the serve command watches for file changes, so you shouldn't need to take any build steps after making a change, just refresh your browser.

## Guidelines

## For bug reports

In your issue, please include the following:

- **Where** it happened, citing URL(s) and a general location on the page, if applicable.
- **What** you were trying to do

The better you describe what happened, the better we can reproduce the behavior and identify the cause.
