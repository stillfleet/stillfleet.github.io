<aside class="hr">So, you wanna play Stillfleet?</aside>

## Grab the Quickstart Rules

(1) 

The [Core Rulebook](https://stillfleet.itch.io/stillfleet-core-rulebook) is only available digitally (reprint to come soon!), and plenty of people are already playing Stillfleet using the jam-packed [Quickstart Rules](https://stillfleet.com/qsr/), which is available as a pay-what-you-want PDF. Go grab this 42-page primer to get you and your friends into a game as soon as possible.

## Find a Game 

(2)

LFG? Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vu3vnm5), introduce yourself, and jump into an ongoing campaign for patrons, or sign up for a one-off venture. These games allow you to cut your teeth on the rules, connect with other players and GMs, and explore the myriad worlds of *Stillfleet* for yourself.

## Become a voidminer 

(3)

Stillfleet is a living game, so it exists in two superimposed states: its future—the Core Rulebook—and its present—the *Stillfleet* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/stillfleet). Joining our Patreon gains you frequent content drops straight from the game designers, first looks at new and developing concepts to be baked into the game, and updates on the game’s future. You can also get involved on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vu3vnm5) to learn from the game designers and other players and GMs how the world of Stillfleet is coming alive, and how you can pillage—or liberate—the stars for yourself. Finally, you can use the Stillfleet app, [STRINGS](https://strings.stillfleet.com/), to power your games with unique random generators.
